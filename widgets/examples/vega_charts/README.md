# Vega-Lite custom widget

[Vega-Lite](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/) is a charting library that uses a high-level grammar to create a variaty of charts.

The example loads the Vega-Lite library and embeds it into a dashboard on the location provided by the dashboard design. It is connected to a BVD channel and can work with real-time as well as non real-time channel data. To make use of the declarative character of Vega-Lite, a Vega-Lite specification can be entered in the widget configuration panel. Also a time span can be specified to define the visible time range of charts with a temporal axis. With a chart specification as config parameter, this plugin can be used to render different types of charts without changing code. The specification has to be in JSON format.

For a simple line chart try the spec below. Make sure you send data with at least two properties: time (a timestamp) and value (some float or int).

```javascript
{
  "mark": "line",
  "encoding": {
    "x": {
      "field": "time",
      "type": "temporal",
      "axis": {
        "labelAngle": -30,
        "format": "%M:%S"
      }
    },
    "y": {
      "field": "value",
      "type": "quantitative"
    }
  }
}
```

Please refer to the Vega-Lite docs for details on the charting grammar.
